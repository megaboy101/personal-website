      <p variant="large">
        Iâ€™m an indie web and game developer currently living the dream
        in âœ¨ New York City âœ¨. In college I co-founded a small web dev
        shop called Studio Reach to help bootstrap local tech startups,
        and more recently led the engineering efforts at a VC-backed
        social-dating startup called The Marriage Pact, along with the
        Checkmate app.
        <br/><br/>
        Outside of work Iâ€™m also active in the open source community,
        primarily in Elixir and the Bevy game engine for Rust.
