    "So here's an interesting question\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we:\n",
    "1. Make `insights` a pure bag of functions, for creating\n",
    "   and manipulating `Pageview` objects. And then use a\n",
    "   common `store` bag of functions for `save()`-ing the\n",
    "   visits\n",
    "   - This how elixir does it\n",
    "2. Make `Insights` \"appear\" to do its own persistence,\n",
    "   internally but actually inject how that's done via\n",
    "   the prototype chain?\n",
    "   - This is how JavaScript APIs more naturally look\n",
    "\n",
    "If I do (1), and then decide I wanna put my saving\n",
    "\"workflow\" into a larger operation, I sorta end up\n",
    "with (2) anyway; from outside observers it just looks\n",
    "like a black box effectful operation. If I wanna avoid,\n",
    "this, I need to make sure my `save()` call is always\n",
    "at the \"topmost\" workflow, and that would require\n",
    "refactoring my original workflow to have a 1-off\n",
    "version for my original workflow, and a composable\n",
    "version for when I want to put that workflow within\n",
    "others. This is effectively what I did with Elixir\n",
    "when working on Checkmate. Tbf it did work but I was\n",
    "never fully satisfied with it, it was complicated and\n",
    "I wanted to get to the level of \"higher-order\"\n",
    "composition, rather than only composing `Multi` objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Would the prototyping approach fare any different?\n",
    "\n",
    "If I had an Insights + Login object, I could write say\n",
    "a Server object with a workflow involving both. The\n",
    "Insights logic would trigger some storage requests, as\n",
    "would the Login logic. This network logic could be easily\n",
    "mocked via prototype overriding, but the overall logic\n",
    "wouldn't inherently be any more optimal. It'd basically\n",
    "be the same in fact. Except with prototypes and method\n",
    "calls I think I don't need to make a `Multi` object, which\n",
    "makes for somewhat cleaner but also more implicit logic\n",
    "\n",
    "I think prototype style may be more the way to go. I can\n",
    "use it to mimic a Phoenix-like style at minimum, but in a\n",
    "way that mimics standard JavaScript APIs more closely\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok but maybe I should separate Visit from TimeStore anyway.\n",
    "The web APIs that deal with storage are never specific to\n",
    "any kind of object. There is no `PersistedDate` object,\n",
    "just Date and LocalStorage. Same with network logic. Python\n",
    "is this way too; it offers APIs for saving data, and\n",
    "specific kinds of data, but never both at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok this isn't necessarily true. The Navigator API is a\n",
    "persisted store for all sorts of data. It is concrete, it\n",
    "manages specifically user-related information, like\n",
    "location or credentials. It is an opinionated, non-generic,\n",
    "effect-ful store\n",
    "\n",
    "By being more opinionated, it's less generic in the kinds\n",
    "of data it can store, but it gives the data it does store\n",
    "a simpler, more bespoke api by comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "By this logic, an effectful `Insights` api is probably fine\n",
    "then. It's opinionated about what it stores, but in return\n",
    "there's a more specific api tailored for working with it.\n",
    "If the effectful nature of it becomes a problem, that's\n",
    "what I can leverage prototypes for\n",
    "\n",
    "But well, is a more specific api better, really? I wanna\n",
    "say in the case of `Navigator` yes. You could not expose\n",
    "specialized apis for getting the users location, and just\n",
    "expose, say, a more generic kv api, and then just say this\n",
    "kv database has a \"location\" key.\n",
    "Is that better? It's fewer new things, you just gotta\n",
    "learn kv's semantics, but it's also more low-level. It\n",
    "conflates location data logic with kv operations. In\n",
    "theory ya I could express location logic _in terms of_ kv\n",
    "operations, but that makes the higher-order location\n",
    "rules more implicit, and not the main focus of the code\n",
    "as it probably should be. This is the advantage of custom\n",
    "semantics, it creates abstraction and lets you read the\n",
    "code at a higher level.\n",
    "The downside is that there's a _lot_ more to learn. When\n",
    "every problem domain has it's own semantics, it means\n",
    "every problem domain becomes unique, rather than sharing\n",
    "common semantics where it makes sense. Moreover, you need\n",
    "to learn the higher-level semantics _and_ the lower-level\n",
    "ones to know if you should extend an existing high-level\n",
    "api, or drop down a level and create something different\n",
    "entirely. Although, I guess you'd only drop down a level\n",
    "when you have to for performance reasons. Moreover, you\n",
    "still need to learn the rules of data when it's written\n",
    "at a lower level. Learning the rules of business logic is\n",
    "easier to grasp when written in terms of high-level\n",
    "operations, rather than low-level patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok so yes, higher-level operations are more specific but\n",
    "easier to grasp. Lower-level operations are more generic,\n",
    "but may understanding any specific operation a bit harder\n",
    "to grasp. You're trading a more general solution for more\n",
    "specialized understandability.\n",
    "\n",
    "So prefer specialized semantics. Build more generalized\n",
    "solutions to underpin their implementations as you develop\n",
    "an understanding for what logic is common vs unique.\n",
    "Specialized semantics described _in terms of_ slightly\n",
    "less specialized semantics, down the chain of abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "If possible, you can do this in javascript via the\n",

    "this idea I'm having\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue I'm thinking about, as I've experienced working\n",
    "on Discord; if you don't _know_ a system with higher-level\n",
    "semantics exist, you default to using the lower-level ones\n",
    "since they're more general to any kind of problem. Also\n",
    "the lower you go, the fewer APIs you need to know in general\n",
    "anyway, since they underpin so many things.\n",
    "For example, if I didn't know the Insights API exists, I\n",
    "may make, say, a `PostInsights` to give me stats on when\n",
    "my posts are viewed, and for how long. It's _mostly_\n",
    "similar to `Insights`, but different enough to where the\n",
    "api looks a bit different under the hood. Now 2 competing\n",
    "solutions exists. And even if I later discovered Insights\n",
    "is a thing, I now gotta do a lot of work to merge in\n",
    "my specialized version with the more general one.\n",
    "How do you combat this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, well I _guess_ in this case `PostInsights` really\n",
    "is just a specialized version of `Insights`. I could change\n",
    "the Post version to follow Insights in the prototype chain,\n",
    "which would make the `PostInsights` implementation _much_\n",
    "shorter, and probably better as well as the more general\n",
    "Insights is probably better tested and well-known\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, now that I think about this, this is really how it\n",
    "ends up at Discord. I make a specialized thing, I realize\n",
    "there's a more general pattern for what I'm doing, and then\n",
    "I have to migrate to that general thing. But I could just\n",
    "lump the general thing under my more specialized thing.\n",
    "And if I learn my specialized thing isn't all that\n",
    "different to the general thing anyway, I can just use their\n",
    "more well-known semantics. But if my specialized thing\n",
    "uses the more general thing in a lot of bespoke and\n",
    "consistent ways, then I ya the prototype chain is the way\n",
    "\n",
    "Damn, I really think I figured this out.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I should just make an Insights API. Make the semantics\n",
    "as specific as you need.\n",
    "- If you're worried about effects being mixed with domain\n",
    "  logic for practical reasons, just dependency inject fake\n",
    "  versions when testing via the prototype chain.\n",
    "- If you're worried about effects being mixed with domain\n",
    "  logic for _conceptual_ reasons, inject abstraction\n",
    "  layers in between. It's fine for Insights methods to\n",
    "  call save logic internally. Each method is self-contained\n",
    "  kv rules. Insights is defined _in terms of_ kv rules.\n",
    "  This ensures things that wanna compose Insights logic\n",
    "  with other things, like a router handler, can do so through\n",
    "  higher-order Insights methods, rather than having to\n",
    "  repeat raw kv operations that muddy the higher-level\n",
    "  insights rule it's trying to express\n",
    "- If you find you need more general semantics for your\n",
    "  insights api, just make a lower-level insights api.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to what I previously believed, the answer is not\n",
    "to find the most general solution to a problem. That will\n",
    "also be the most low-level solution. It's ok to have a\n",
    "specific solution to a specific problem. You can refactor\n",

    "\n",
