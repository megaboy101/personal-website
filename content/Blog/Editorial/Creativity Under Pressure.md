- I love doing design work, but only as a hobby or on personal projects. Doing design as work or under pressure is an extreme nightmare for me. I get much more stressed about quality and speed, and constantly want to change the design completely, which isn’t realistic in a work environment
- Engineering work isn’t as fulfilling, but I’m much more consistent with it, especially in a work environment. I think this is because you typically engineer to a spec, so there is a clearly defined goal you can measure your success against. Theres a sort of liberating freedom in not having to design, because your contributions are much more clearly defined and success is clearer cut. But at the same time, I think design sense is essential for product development. Engineers should be able to make good design decisions
