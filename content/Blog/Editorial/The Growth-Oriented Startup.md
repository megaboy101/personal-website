# The Who

    - Final decider on what growth experiments are run
    - Creates and keeps track of company goals & metrics, and whether team is meeting them
    - Runs a growth meeting once a week to review goals, experiment results, and progress
    - Must be focused on a single goal that typically correlates to core metrics, and keeps the process from being derailed
