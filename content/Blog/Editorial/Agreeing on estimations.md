Managers and workers fundamentally have a clash of incentives when it comes to laying out deadlines. Workers are paid regardless of how much value is delivered, so they are incentivized to make deadlines as far away as possible. Managers have to deliver as much value in as short a time as possible, so they are incentivized to make deadlines as short as possible. How do you reconcile this?
