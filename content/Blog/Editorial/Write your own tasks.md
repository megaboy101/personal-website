Early on I felt that having a central place where teams wrote up tasks was the perfect way to do development. But, while I still think that thinking things through is a smart move, I am less persuaded by the centralized write and execute style. Writing operationally-perfect feature specs is draining, and so are executing on them. It makes you feel like a code monkey. Plus, it just doesnâ€™t jive with some people. At MP, we have found that giving individuals the freedom to write their own specs in the way that best suits them to be more effective for our small, rapidly changing product development environment
