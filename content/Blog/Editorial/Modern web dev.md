Modern web dev is 3 things:
- **Design engineering**: The ability to express visual design and interaction design in the actual physical product
- **Peripheral engineering**: The ability to utilitize the various platforms features offered to us. This is almost always netcode, but is also things like wasm and cookies and pwa and so on
- **Operations engineering**: The ability to host and release the product
These are horizontal skills. Feature development pierces into all 3
