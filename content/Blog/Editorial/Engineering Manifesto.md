General Principles:
- Work in cross-functional teams around a single project
- There should always be at least 2 people to a project, and at least 1 developer and 1 designer/coordinator
- Teams should be no larger than 5, and shouldn't have more than 2 designers (1 is fine in most cases anyway)
- Teams meet at the beginning of the week to run IPM (Iteration Planning Meeting)
- Teams meet at the end of the week to run Retro (retrospective)
