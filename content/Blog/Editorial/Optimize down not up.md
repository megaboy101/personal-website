A theory I’ve had about tech libraries I think since lambda first dropped.
You can do stack improvements in 2 ways. Bottom up, where you build on a better solution from the get go, or top down, where you migrate an existing system to a better solution.
I think top down is the way to go. It technically reaults in more work involved in migration, but when you’re at that point you can much more objectively evaluate if something like lambda will be a solution that works for you.
This is true for so many things in tech, and I’m thinking about it again with stuff like htmx.
