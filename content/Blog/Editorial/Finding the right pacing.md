Weâ€™ve noticed at MP that 2 weeks isn't a good cycle system for us. It's too short for us to deliver anything we find meaningful. We end up cutting corners and running over, and it's just not a fun experience. We want to experiment with longer time frames to find a better balance between working fast but delivering chunks of work that move the needle
