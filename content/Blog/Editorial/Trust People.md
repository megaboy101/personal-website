Something Iâ€™ve noticed over the course of many projects and having worked with many different teams.
Giving people individual agency and trust is the way to creating better products.
Dictation, where a manager or leader imposes a vision onto others, results in subpar creative thinking, and can really burn out a team.
When engineers and designers are reduced to cogs that take some input and are expected to produce some output, they will feel it, and their sense of personal fulfilment and professional investment in an idea will diminish.
