# Introduction
- Landing Pages are the storefront or book cover of your product or service
- The primary purpose of a landing page is to maximize conversion rate, or the % of visitors who arrive at your site that complete the acquisition event (i.e. signup for your product)
    - Remember to do your homework on what a standard conversion rate is for your industry, as it can vary widely. For SaaS apps this hovers around 3%, for TurboTax it's as high as 70%
- Unless your product is a consumer software application, you typically don't need to worry about creating a landing page until you're ready to enter stage 2 of development
# 7 Questions to Ask for Landing Page Success
1. What is your Call To Action?
    - The trigger for your acquisition event should be as obvious and omnipresent as possible, without being in the way
    - This should ideally be placed alongside the part of your landing page that triggers the "Aha!" moment most often
2. What is this?
    - A good litmus test for this is: Could I copy a sentence from this page, send it to my mom, and have her be able to understand what the product is?
3. Is it right for me?
    - A user needs to see a reflection of their problem in your landing page, to help them evaluate if they are in the right place
4. Is is legit?
    - You site should not look unprofessional. The bar isn't that high for this, and you can usually just use a solid design template to check this box
5. Who else is using it?
    - People are inherently reluctant to use something that nobody else it. Showing who is using your product and how is a shortcut to the above 2 steps
6. How much is it?/What is the catch?
    - If your product costs money, include a pricing page. Most SaaS business's lose customers simply by not including a pricing page
7. Where can I get help?
    - Include links to documentation and resources. If they exist, link to forums as well
    - Include a direct line to a living person who can answer product questions. Many user's will not do anything until they talk to a real person
