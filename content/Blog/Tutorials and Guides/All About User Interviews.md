# Introduction
- All members of a founding team need to participate in user discussion, including technical founders. This process CANNOT be outsourced
- Personal interviews need to be carried out most frequently in stages 0, 1, and 2. Keep interviewing until you simply have too many users to keep track of, then transition to wider-net analysis tools
# Common Pitfalls To Avoid
- Talk about their life, _not your idea_
    - The goal is to _extract_ information from your interviewee, not to _sell_ your idea
    - It's important to understand the entire picture of your audience, not just their problem at hand
- Talk specifics, not hypotheticals
    - "Would you..." questions aren't honest
    - People are bad with hypotheticals, and tend to lie to save face
- Listen, don't talk
    - Let the interviewee be the guide to your product
# Important Questions to Ask
1. What is the hardest part [about the thing you do]?
    - Look for problems that are being faced on a regular basis or that are painful enough to warrant solving. This question can help confirm for you whether the problem that you're working on is actually a pain point, and that your interviewee feels is something that they actively want to solve in their life.
2. Tell me about the last time you experienced this problem?
    - This helps establish context for when the problem occurs
    - This also helps build a catalog of real-life instances where the problem occured for people, that you can then overlay with your solution
3. Why was it so hard?
    - You'll hear many different answers from many different people on this
    - Why a past problem was so hard can inform your messaging as you build out the rest of your product
4. What, if anything, have you done to solve the problem?
    - If potential solutions are not already being explored, it's possible that the problem you're trying to solve is not a burning enough problem to begin with. This question tries to get at the root of that issue.
    - This can also give you an idea of what your solution landscape looks like? What will your product be compared against as you end up rolling out your solution and offering it to your audience?
5. What don't you love about the solutions you've tried?
    - This question specifically targets, what are the problems with the existing solutions that they've already tried? These are specifics and from this, you can begin to figure out what the differential between your new solution and the existing solutions already in the market will be
