An issue that was presented to us at Marriage Pact. To make a strong pitch for investors, we need to show strong levels of engagement. This has created a push from management onto the product team to come up with ways to engage our audience on a more regular basis. But this creates a problem, because there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of interest from our audience to engage on a daily basis with our product. There is a disconnect between what our investors need, and what our users want. So the question is, are we solving a real problem?
