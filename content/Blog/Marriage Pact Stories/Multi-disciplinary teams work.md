Probably one of the best things I've have noticed while working on Marriage Pact. I've often read that you should build with cross-disciplinary teams, but seeing it in action really gives me a better appreciation for it. When you have people all faced with the same problem, but coming from vastly differing perspectives, they will solve problems in ways each individual contributor would never even think to entertain. I've noticed this most on the product team, where my 2 colleagues come from a more traditional design background (whereas I have a more software-oriented background). There are entire concepts they will throw out simply because they thought it was technically impossible, only to find out it could be done with relative ease. Or moreover, they will simply accept certain hardships in their process because they can't reason about a way to improve it _as a designer_. And the reverse is true for me as well.
