I have redesigned my personal site over a dozen times at this point.
I really love the home-grown aesthetics many personal sites have. I love that they're often unrefined. They're personal, they feel lived in.
So I've been trying to make my site like this for YEARS.
And at this point, I've come to the terms that it just isn't *me*
It's my *taste*, but not my *talent* I guess (need a better term for this)

On the flip side, I'm kinda hate those pretentious, hyper-minimalist to the point of being clinical personal sites. [This website] catalogues them pretty well. They're always associated with startup bros. Dudes who are "too cool" for web design. They're completely devoid of personality or opinion. *Take a stance* I wanna say. 

They always remind me of this quote from Paul Fussellâ€™s _Class: A Guide Through the American Status System_:
> [...] _your real middle class refuses to show any but the most bland books and magazines on its coffee tables: otherwise, expressions of opinion, awkward questions, or even ideas might result._

And so I've toiled on trying to make a website of personality for ages

And you know what, I've hated all of them. And not in the artististic sense of "oh I can point out the flaws in this design for ages". Like real, practical issues with the layout, type spacing, loading time, content organization, stuff like that. I spent so much time on aesthetics that I:
1. Burned out to the point of losing all concept of what I even want or like
2. Sacrificed every part of the actual user experience in favor of aesthetics

So, after *over a year* of on-and-off redesigns, I've decided to settle on what I can *accept*, in favor of what I *love*.

And you know what, I've actually learned to like it a bit. It's easy to tweak, the visual language is loosely held. Adding new elements like images or code blocks takes barely any visual forethought at all. It works, and it gets out of my way, and that's all I need.

And, in a sense, I've found that *this* is my visual language. I'm neurotic. I'm extremely perfectionistic. I love to fidget and pet my work.

This visual language says:
> This vibe is *so* minimal it's practically invisible
> You have **no choice** but to focus on something else

And for me, that's liberating. It lets me move forward. I can actually get back to what I intended to do here, which is write.

My Obsidian setup is very similar in this respect. I learned a long time ago that the more customizable a system is, the less time I'll actually spend using it. So I've very proactively setup my obsidian to cutout almost all of it's features. I just wanna focus on writing. Unstructured, unrefined, inconsistent writing. And it's worked very well for me.

Hopefully someday I'll be kinder with myself, and give less of a damn about the millions of imperfections in my personal aesthetic. But until then, I'm content

Long live minimal design.
