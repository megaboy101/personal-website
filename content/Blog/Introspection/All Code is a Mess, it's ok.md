I really kinda hate most code.

I'm not someone with vast reserves of brain ram. I don't have the best intuition about author intent. I struggle almost daily with understanding the work of my coworkers. I'm very much a [grug brained](https://grugbrain.dev/) developer.

Ryan Dhal (of Node/Deno fame) has a [great related rant](https://tinyclouds.org/rant), and while I don't necessarily agree with all of this assertions, he definitely captures the *toil* I often feel with coding.

And yet, almost a decade later, I'm still at it almost daily. 

So, to keep my head from exploding, I've historically been someone who cares a *lot* about code quality, clarity, and simplicity. I care about correctness (types, tests), I care about consistency (linters, code reviews), and I care about interpretability (lots of comments, docs, [screaming architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2011/09/30/Screaming-Architecture.html)).

But, despite my best efforts, I've *always* failed in this somehow. Entropy has always won, whether that's in a large scaleup, small startup, or even just my personal projects.

This has always left me frustrated at work (*why am I the only one who cares about this, and it's getting **worse** by the day*) and disappointed at home (*why am I incapable of keeping things organized. Do I just suck??*)

But lately, I've been developing an alternative intuition to this. I've been reading a lot about the nature of creativity. Creativity is not something you can necessarily control, only temporarily manage. [It's not a horse, it's a mountain lion](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/creativity_things).

Most code, I think, is creative. There definitely is a scientific element to it, but I would describe most of *my* work as making creative tradeoffs, not finding objective solutions. As a result, it's subject to many of the general phenomena of creativity. Projects are full of half-baked ideas, different features develop at different rates, inconsistency reigns, ideas rot and get abandoned.

This is not a sign of weakness in the author or team. Rather, it's a sign of good resolve. Whereas historically I would view this as a disease to cleanse with ruthless tenacity, I think I can now view it with more compassion. Messes certainly aren't without their tradeoffs, but they're also a sign you're moving forward. It's not lingering, or ruminating.

Fear not the messy but productive codebase.
Fear the beautiful one that's never seen the light of day.
