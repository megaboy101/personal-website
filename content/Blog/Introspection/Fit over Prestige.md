I feel like I've focused a lot of my career direction on prestige:
- Prestige means something different to everyone. To me this meant startups, but to others it could mean Google
- I've often taken the first offer given for companies that looked cool. I cared less about whether I would actually like working there or be able to thrive there. I would mold myself to whatever they wanted, because their prestige was *my* prestige
	- This has caused a bad cycle of burnout, existentialism, and explosion/quitting

These days, I'm trying to focus more on fit. It matters less whether the company I'm working for is cool or hip. What matters is whether I can be my best self in that environment.
- In some regard this does impact what kinds of companies I'd approach. I don't want a company doing knowingly bad things, like Facebook. But in addition to not wanting this on altruistic grounds, I also don't want this because I would be personally uncomfortable doing that kind of work, and that would seep into the quality of the work I produce.
